# DamDoh Platform: Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the tiered, non-transactional SaaS business model for the DamDoh platform. Our strategy is to drive wide adoption with a powerful free tier while capturing value from professional and enterprise stakeholders who derive significant commercial benefit from our tools and data.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Value-Based Tiering**: Tiers are structured based on the value a stakeholder segment derives from the platform.
2.  **Network Effects First**: A robust free tier is essential to build a critical mass of users, which makes the platform valuable for everyone.
3.  **Non-Transactional Core**: Our revenue comes from software and data services, not from processing payments or taking a percentage of our users' transactions.
4.  **Data as a Product (Consent-Based)**: For enterprise clients, our most valuable asset is aggregated, anonymized, and consent-based data that helps them de-risk their business decisions.

## The Four Tiers

#### Example: Monetizing a Financial Institution (FI)

We will not charge per transaction or take a percentage of loans. Instead, we provide value through data and workflow integration, for which we charge a recurring license fee.

1.  **The "Hook" (Freemium)**: The FI can create a basic profile on the platform for free, making them discoverable by farmers seeking funding.
2.  **The Product (Enterprise License)**:
    *   **Tier 1 License ($5,000/year)**: Access to the FI Dashboard to receive and manage up to 100 applications per month originating from the DamDoh platform. Includes basic applicant profile data.
    *   **Tier 2 License ($15,000/year)**: Includes everything in Tier 1, plus API access to the AI-generated credit risk scores for applicants who consent to share their data. This is our core value proposition, as it helps the FI de-risk their portfolio.
    *   **Tier 3 License (Custom Price)**: Includes everything in Tier 2, plus API access to broader, anonymized datasets for market analysis (e.g., "What is the average yield and profitability of coffee farmers in the Rift Valley region?").

This model aligns our revenue directly with the value we provide—reducing risk and providing qualified, data-rich leads—without interfering in the financial transaction between the FI and the farmer.
