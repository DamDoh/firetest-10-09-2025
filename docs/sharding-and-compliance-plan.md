# Sharding and Compliance Plan for DamDoh

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the long-term strategy for two important scalability and compliance features for the DamDoh application: application-level sharding and GDPR/CCPA compliance. While these features are not critical for the initial public release, they are essential for the long-term health and success of the platform.

## 2. Application-Level Sharding Strategy

### 2.1. Rationale

As the DamDoh platform grows to millions of users, certain high-volume collections will become "hotspots" and may exceed Firestore's write limits (currently 10,000 writes per second per database). To address this, we will implement application-level sharding for these collections.

### 2.2. Target Collections for Sharding

*   `notifications`
*   `traceability_events`
*   `profile_views`
*   `likes`

### 2.3. Sharding Implementation Plan

1.  **Create Sharded Collections:** For each target collection, we will create a set of sharded collections (e.g., `notifications_0`, `notifications_1`, `notifications_2`, etc.).
2.  **Implement a Sharding Function:** We will create a utility function that takes a user ID or document ID as input and returns the appropriate shard number. This function will use a simple hashing algorithm to ensure an even distribution of data across the shards.
3.  **Update Application Code:** We will update the application code to use the sharding function when writing to the sharded collections.
4.  **Update Queries:** We will update our queries to read from all of the sharded collections simultaneously. This can be done using `Promise.all()` to query each shard in parallel and then merge the results.

## 3. GDPR/CCPA Compliance Strategy

### 3.1. Rationale

To comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, we must provide users with the ability to export their data and to delete their accounts and all associated data.

### 3.2. Data Export Implementation Plan

1.  **Create a Data Export Function:** We will create a new Cloud Function called `exportUserData` that takes a user ID as input.
2.  **Gather User Data:** This function will query all relevant collections to gather the user's data, including their profile, marketplace listings, forum posts, etc.
3.  **Generate a JSON Export:** The function will generate a JSON file containing all of the user's data.
4.  **Upload to Cloud Storage:** The JSON file will be uploaded to a private Cloud Storage bucket.
5.  **Send a Download Link:** The function will generate a secure, time-limited download link for the JSON file and email it to the user.

### 3.3. Data Deletion Implementation Plan

1.  **Create a Data Deletion Function:** We will create a new Cloud Function called `deleteUserData` that is triggered when a user's account is deleted from Firebase Authentication.
2.  **Perform a Cascade Delete:** This function will perform a "cascade delete" to remove all of the user's data from all relevant collections.
3.  **Use a Batched Write:** To avoid exceeding Firestore's rate limits, the function will use a batched write to delete the data in chunks.
4.  **Log the Deletion:** The function will log the deletion for auditing purposes.

## 4. Timeline and Next Steps

These features are planned for a post-launch release. The next steps will be to create detailed technical specifications for each of these features and to prioritize them on our product roadmap. By planning for these features now, we can ensure that we are well-prepared to meet the scalability and compliance challenges of a global platform.
