# Monitoring and Alerting Plan for DamDoh

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategy for the DamDoh application. The goal is to ensure high availability, performance, and reliability for our global user base by proactively identifying and responding to issues. We will leverage Google Cloud's Operations Suite, including Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Alerting, to achieve this.

## 2. Key Monitoring Areas

We will focus on four key areas of the application:

*   **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Monitoring user experience, client-side errors, and performance.
*   **Backend Services (Cloud Functions & Cloud Run):** Monitoring the health, performance, and error rates of our server-side logic.
*   **Database (Firestore):** Monitoring database performance, usage, and security.
*   **Business Metrics:** Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) that are critical to the success of the platform.

## 3. Monitoring & Alerting Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Frontend Application Monitoring

*   **Tool:** Firebase Performance Monitoring & Crashlytics.
*   **Metrics to Track:**
    *   Page load times
    *   API response times
    *   Client-side JavaScript errors
    *   Application crashes and hangs
*   **Alerts to Configure:**
    *   **High Crash Rate:** Alert when the crash-free user rate drops below 99.5%.
    *   **Slow Page Load:** Alert when the 90th percentile page load time exceeds 3 seconds.

### 3.2. Backend Services Monitoring (Cloud Functions & Cloud Run)

*   **Tool:** Cloud Logging & Cloud Monitoring.
*   **Metrics to Track:**
    *   Function execution counts and duration
    *   Error rates (per function)
    *   Memory and CPU usage (for Cloud Run)
    *   Cold start duration
*   **Alerts to Configure:**
    *   **High Function Error Rate:** Alert when the error rate for any function exceeds 1% over a 5-minute period.
    *   **High Function Latency:** Alert when the 95th percentile execution time for a critical function (e.g., `performSearch`, `uploadOfflineChanges`) exceeds 2 seconds.
    *   **Cloud Run High CPU/Memory:** Alert when the CPU or memory utilization of the `damdoh-ai-service` exceeds 80% for more than 10 minutes.

### 3.3. Database Monitoring (Firestore)

*   **Tool:** Cloud Monitoring & Firestore Dashboard.
*   **Metrics to Track:**
    *   Read/write/delete operations per second
    *   Active connections
    *   Document reads/writes per query
    *   Security rule denials
*   **Alerts to Configure:**
    *   **High Firestore Usage:** Alert when the number of reads or writes exceeds 80% of the daily quota.
    *   **High Security Rule Denial Rate:** Alert when the rate of security rule denials exceeds 5% of all requests, as this could indicate a security issue or a bug in the application.

### 3.4. Business Metrics Monitoring

*   **Tool:** Custom Dashboards in Cloud Monitoring, powered by Log-Based Metrics.
*   **Metrics to Track:**
    *   New user sign-ups
    *   New marketplace listings created
    *   Number of forum posts and replies
    *   Number of offline sync operations
*   **Alerts to Configure:**
    *   **Sudden Drop in User Activity:** Alert if the number of new user sign-ups or marketplace listings drops by more than 50% compared to the previous day.
    *   **Unusual Spike in a Metric:** Alert if any key business metric increases by more than 200% in an hour, as this could indicate either a positive event or a potential issue (e.g., a bot attack).

## 4. Implementation Steps

1.  **Enable Firebase Performance Monitoring and Crashlytics** in the frontend application.
2.  **Create Custom Log-Based Metrics** in Cloud Logging for our key business metrics.
3.  **Build Custom Dashboards** in Cloud Monitoring to visualize the health and performance of the entire system.
4.  **Configure Alerting Policies** in Cloud Alerting for each of the alerts defined above.
5.  **Establish an On-Call Rotation** and a clear process for responding to alerts.

By implementing this plan, we will have the visibility we need to operate a world-class application and provide a reliable and performant experience for our users.
