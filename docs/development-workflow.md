    2.  **Marketplace Integration (DONE):** The "Create Listing" flow allows sellers to link products directly to a VTI, significantly increasing their value and trustworthiness to buyers.
    3.  **Public Traceability View (DONE):** Created the public-facing VTI lookup page where any user can scan or enter a VTI to see the full, auditable journey of a product.
    4.  **Talent Exchange (DONE):** Built out the "Talent Exchange" as a specialized part of the marketplace for service listings, creating a hub for agricultural expertise.

### **Phase 3: Foster Community & Network Growth (The Ecosystem)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

*   **Goal:** Build the social and professional fabric that turns a tool into a thriving community.
*   **Achievements:**
    1.  **Core Networking (DONE):** The "My Network" hub is fully functional, allowing users to send, receive, and manage connection requests.
    2.  **Social Feed (DONE):** The main dashboard features a dynamic social feed with full capabilities for creating posts (text, images, polls), commenting, and liking.
