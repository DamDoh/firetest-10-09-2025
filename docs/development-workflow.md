# DamDoh Super App - Development Workflow

This document outlines a phased, logical workflow for building the core features of the DamDoh super app. The goal is to move from foundational functionalities to a fully integrated, multi-stakeholder ecosystem.

### **Phase 1: Foundational User & Farm Management (Core Operations)**

*   **Goal:** Solidify the core data and actions for the primary user (the Farmer). This phase ensures the basic "single-player" mode is robust and valuable before adding complex interactions.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **AI Expertise (DONE):** Implement AI-driven crop diagnosis and a specialized knowledge base for FGW/KNF. This establishes the "smart" nature of the platform early on.
    2.  **Farm & Crop Management (NEXT):** Build out the primary "My Farms" dashboard. This will be the farmer's home base.
        *   UI to list all of a user's farms.
        *   Functionality to create, view details of, and edit a farm.
        *   Within each farm, implement the ability to log and manage individual crops or batches, tracking their lifecycle from planting to harvest.
    3.  **Labor & Input Tracking:**
        *   Build the "Labor Management" module for tracking workers, hours, and payments.
        *   Enhance the "KNF Inputs" module to track usage against specific crops.
    4.  **Financials:** Implement the "Money Matters" hub for basic income/expense logging, providing farmers with a clear financial overview of their operations.

### **Phase 2: Enable Commerce & Traceability (The Value Chain)**

*   **Goal:** Connect the farm's production to the marketplace and build the core "trust layer" of the app through traceability.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Harvest-to-VTI:** Flesh out the "Log Harvest" function. This action will be the critical link that creates a new Verifiable Traceability ID (VTI) for a specific batch of produce.
    2.  **Marketplace Integration:** Enhance the "Create Listing" flow in the Marketplace to allow sellers to link their product directly to a VTI. This makes listings more valuable and trustworthy.
    3.  **Public Traceability View:** Create the public-facing VTI lookup page. Users (including consumers) can scan a QR code or enter a VTI to see the full journey of a product.
    4.  **Talent Exchange:** Build out the "Talent Exchange" as a specialized part of the marketplace for service listings (e.g., agronomy, equipment rental, labor).

### **Phase 3: Foster Community & Network Growth (The Ecosystem)**

*   **Goal:** Build the social and professional fabric that turns a tool into a community. This phase focuses on user-to-user interaction and network effects.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Core Networking:** Implement the "My Network" feature, allowing users to send, receive, and manage connection requests.
    2.  **Social Feed:** Enhance the main dashboard's social feed with full capabilities for creating posts (with text, images, polls), commenting, and liking.
    3.  **Forums & Groups:** Build out the dedicated Forums for topic-specific discussions and private/public Groups for collaboration.
    4.  **Direct Messaging:** Implement the one-on-one messaging system for private conversations between connected users.

### **Phase 4: Scale with Specialized Hubs (Super App Integration)**

*   **Goal:** Transition from a farmer-centric tool to a true multi-stakeholder super app by introducing tailored dashboards and functionalities for other key roles.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Financial Institution Hub:** Build the dashboard for FIs to review loan/grant applications, view risk profiles, and manage their listed financial products.
    2.  **Agro-Tourism Hub:** Create a dedicated dashboard for tourism operators to manage their listings, bookings, and guest interactions.
    3.  **Insurance Hub:** Implement the dashboard for Insurance Providers to manage policies and process claims.
    4.  **Continued Expansion:** Systematically build out the hubs for other critical stakeholders as defined in the architecture (Regulators, Exporters, Logistics Providers, etc.), integrating them into the existing data flows.

This phased approach ensures that each new feature builds upon a stable and functional foundation, leading to a more robust and cohesive final application.
