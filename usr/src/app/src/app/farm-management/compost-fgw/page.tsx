            In Farming God's Way, we are called to be good stewards of the land God has entrusted to us. Making compost is a wonderful way to do this. Good compost is like "black gold" for your soil. It helps:

            <li><strong className="font-medium">Hold Water:</strong> Healthy soil with compost holds water much better, so your plants are less likely to suffer during dry spells.</li>
            <li><strong className="font-medium">Provide Nutrients:</strong> It slowly releases food (nutrients) for your plants, helping them grow strong and healthy without needing expensive chemical fertilizers.</li>
            <li><strong className="font-medium">Reduce Waste:</strong> You can turn farm and kitchen waste (like leftover plants and vegetable scraps) into something valuable.</li>
            <li><strong className="font-medium">Protect God's Creation:</strong> By recycling nutrients and improving the soil, we care for the environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
            Farming God's Way emphasizes minimal soil disturbance, using "God's Blanket" (mulch), and practicing high standards. Compost is a key ingredient in achieving these standards and improving your land faithfully.

Aim for roughly 2-3 parts Brown to 1 part Green by volume if possible, but don't worry too much about exact ratios to start â€“ a good mix is key, and manure will supercharge it.</p>

          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Choose Your Spot & Size:</strong> Find a suitable location. A good size for a compost pile is about 1 meter wide x 1 meter long x 1 meter high (3-4 feet cube). This size helps the pile heat up properly. You can make it larger if you have lots of materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Prepare the Base:</strong> Loosen the soil at the base of where your pile will be. Then, lay down a first layer of coarse "Brown" materials like small twigs or chopped maize stalks (about 4-6 inches or 10-15cm thick). This helps with aeration (air flow) and drainage from the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Start Layering:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm">
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Brown Layer:</strong> Add a layer of "Brown" materials (e.g., dry leaves, straw) about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) thick.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Green Layer:</strong> Add a thinner layer of "Green" materials (e.g., kitchen scraps, fresh grass) about 3-4 inches (7-10cm) thick.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Manure Layer (If Using):</strong> If you have manure, add a layer of it (1-2 inches or 2-5cm, or mix it with the green layer).</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">(Optional) Soil/Compost Sprinkle:</strong> Lightly sprinkle a thin layer of garden soil or finished compost over the green/manure layer.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Water Gently:</strong> Sprinkle water over the layers so they are damp, but not soaking wet. It should feel like a wrung-out sponge.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Repeat Layers:</strong> Continue alternating these layers (Brown, Green, optional Manure, optional Soil/Compost, Water) until your pile reaches the desired height (about 1 meter or 3-4 feet). Try to make the pile wider at the base and slightly tapered towards the top, like a loaf of bread or a small mound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Shape the Top:</strong> It's good to make a slight dip or depression in the center of the top of the pile to help catch rainwater.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Cover Your Pile ("God's Blanket"):</strong> Finish with a thicker layer of "Brown" material on top (like straw or dry grass), about 4-6 inches (10-15cm). This is "God's Blanket." It helps to:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm">
                <li>Keep moisture in.</li>
                <li>Prevent the pile from getting too wet from heavy rain.</li>
                <li>Keep flies away.</li>
                <li>Maintain a more even temperature.</li>
            </ul>
             You can also use a piece of old carpet (natural fibers only), hessian sacks, or a compost cover sheet if available, but ensure there's still some air circulation.

          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Maintain Moisture:</strong> Your compost pile needs to be consistently moist, like a squeezed sponge. Check it every few days, especially in dry weather. If you dig into the center and it feels dry, add water. If it's too wet (smells bad or is slimy), you might need to add more dry "Brown" materials and turn it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Monitor Temperature:</strong> A well-working compost pile will heat up in the center (it can get quite hot, 55-65Â°C or 130-150Â°F). This heat is good as it kills weed seeds and harmful germs. You can feel the heat by pushing a stick or metal rod into the center for a few minutes, then pulling it out. If it's not heating up, it might be too dry, too wet, or need more "Green" materials (or manure).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">Turn the Pile (Mixing for Aeration):</strong> Turning the pile is important to provide air (oxygen) to the microorganisms doing the work and to ensure all materials decompose evenly.
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm">
                <li><strong className="font-medium">When to Turn:</strong> A good time to first turn the pile is after about 2-4 weeks, especially if it has heated up and started to cool down. After that, turn it every 2-4 weeks.</li>
                <li><strong className="font-medium">How to Turn:</strong> Use a pitchfork or shovel. Move the material from the outside of the pile to the center, and the material from the center to the outside. Try to break up any clumps. Add water if it's dry as you turn.</li>
            </ul>

          <li><strong className="font-medium">Troubleshooting:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm">
                <li><strong className="font-medium">Bad Smell (like ammonia or rotten eggs):</strong> Pile is likely too wet or has too much "Green" material/fresh manure. Add more "Browns" and turn it.</li>
                <li><strong className="font-medium">Pile is Not Heating Up:</strong> Could be too dry (add water), too small, not enough "Greens"/manure (add more and mix), or too cold (try to make it bigger or insulate it).</li>
                <li><strong className="font-medium">Pests (like rats):</strong> Avoid adding meat, dairy, or oily foods. Ensure kitchen scraps are buried in the center of the pile. A well-managed hot pile usually deters pests.
