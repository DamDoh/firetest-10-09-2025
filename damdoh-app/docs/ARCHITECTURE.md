# DamDoh Platform Architecture

## Mission & Vision

DamDoh is a specialized social platform for the global agricultural ecosystem. Its mission is to empower all 24 stakeholder types—from Farmers to Consumers—by fostering collaboration, transparency, and innovation. The vision is to be the "LinkedIn" for global agriculture, built on a hyper-scalable, resilient, and intelligent foundation.

## Core Principles

- **Vibrant Traceability ID (VTI):** The immutable atomic unit of trust for every product, forming a blockchain-enhanced, auditable chain of custody.
- **AI-Powered Engine:** Provides predictive insights, personalized recommendations, and intelligent assistants (like the Farming Assistant).
- **Stakeholder-Centric Design:** Tailored profiles and features for all 24 stakeholders in the supply chain.
- **Global & Inclusive:** Designed with multi-language support, multi-currency transactions, and offline-first capabilities for remote regions.

## The 14 Core Modules

1.  **Core Data & Traceability Engine (Module 1):** Manages Master Data (products, inputs, certifications) and the VTI system. Logs every event in a product's lifecycle, forming an immutable chain of custody. Integrates with satellite and weather data.
2.  **User & Profile Management (Module 2):** Handles registration, authentication, and detailed, role-specific profiles for all stakeholders, including KYC/AML integration points.
3.  **Farm & Asset Management (Module 3):** The farmer's operational hub for managing fields, crop/livestock batches, KNF inputs, and inventory. This is a primary source of VTI event data.
4.  **Marketplace & E-commerce (Module 4):** The commercial engine for trading products, services, and talent. Manages listings (linked to VTIs), orders, and promotions.
5.  **Community & Collaboration (Module 5):** The social layer, featuring forums, private groups, direct messaging, and a main social feed to foster knowledge sharing.
6.  **AI & Analytics Engine (Module 6):** The intelligence core (powered by Genkit). Provides the Farming Assistant, market insights, connection recommendations, and the universal search interpreter.
7.  **Financial & Transaction Services (Module 7):** Facilitates secure payments, a digital wallet, credit scoring based on platform activity, and connections to funding opportunities.
8.  **Knowledge Hub & Education (Module 8):** A repository for courses, articles, and guides on best practices (especially KNF/FGW). This data powers the AI Farming Assistant.
9.  **API Gateway & Integrations (Module 9):** The secure bridge for integrating with third-party services like weather APIs, IoT devices, and external logistics platforms.
10. **Regulatory & Compliance (Module 10):** Tools to help stakeholders navigate regulations, manage compliance, and generate reports for auditors.
11. **Insurance Services (Module 11):** Connects farmers with insurance providers, using platform data for risk assessment and automated claim processing.
12. **Sustainability & Impact Tracking (Module 12):** Measures and reports on the environmental impact of farming practices, including carbon footprint tracking.
13. **Notifications System (Module 13):** A cross-cutting service that delivers real-time, personalized alerts (in-app, push, SMS) based on events from all other modules.
14. **Offline Synchronization (Module 14):** Ensures the app remains functional in areas with limited connectivity by queuing changes and syncing upon reconnection.
