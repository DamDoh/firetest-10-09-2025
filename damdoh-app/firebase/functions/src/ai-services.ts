/**
 * =================================================================
 * Module 6: The AI & Analytics Engine (The Brain of DamDoh)
 * =================================================================
 * This module is the intelligence core of the DamDoh Super App, leveraging
 * Genkit and other AI/ML tools to provide predictive insights, personalized
 * recommendations, and intelligent assistance across the entire platform.
 *
 * @purpose To transform raw agricultural data into actionable intelligence,
 * empowering farmers and stakeholders with data-driven decision-making,
 * optimizing processes, predicting market trends, and facilitating precision
 * agriculture globally.
 *
 * @key_concepts
 * - Farming Assistant: Provides personalized agronomic advice (e.g., KNF/FGW),
 *   crop diagnosis, and platform guidance. (See: farming-assistant-flow.ts)
 * - Market Insights & Price Prediction: Analyzes market data to forecast trends.
 * - Connection & Recommendation Engine: Suggests relevant connections to users.
 * - Universal Search Interpreter: Uses NLP to understand complex search queries.
 * - Yield Prediction & Crop Health Monitoring: Leverages farm and satellite data.
 * - Sustainability Optimization: Suggests practices to improve environmental impact.
 *
 * @synergy
 * - Consumes data from nearly all other modules (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12).
 * - Provides intelligent outputs back to users via the app and other modules.
 * - Uses the Genkit framework for all AI flows and tool definitions.
