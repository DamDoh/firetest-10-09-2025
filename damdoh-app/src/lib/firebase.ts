// This file is obsolete.
// Its original purpose of providing database helper functions has been superseded.
// - For client-side Firebase interactions (auth, firestore, etc.), use the initialized exports from 'src/lib/firebase/client.ts'.
// - For reusable database queries, use the functions provided in 'src/lib/db-utils.ts'.
// This file can be safely deleted in a future cleanup.
