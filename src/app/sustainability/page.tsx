        Conceptual UI for the Sustainability and Impact Tracking Section

        This page will serve as a hub for users to track their
        sustainable practices, view impact metrics, manage certifications,
        and access tools related to environmental and social responsibility
        within the agricultural supply chain.

        Sections might include:
        1.  Sustainability Overview Dashboard:
            - Key metrics (e.g., water usage efficiency, carbon footprint estimate, biodiversity score).
            - Visualizations of progress over time.
            - Highlights of recent sustainable activities logged.

        2.  Certification Management:
            - List of certifications held (Organic, Fair Trade, etc.).
            - Status of applications/renewals.
            - Option to upload or link digital certificates.
            - Information on available certifications relevant to their profile.

        3.  Sustainable Practices Log:
            - A logbook or form to record specific sustainable activities (e.g., cover cropping, reduced tillage, renewable energy use, waste reduction efforts).
            - Option to upload photos or documentation.

        4.  Carbon Credit Tracking (Conceptual):
            - Integration point with potential carbon credit programs.
            - Display of estimated carbon sequestered or emissions reduced.
            - Link to tools for measuring/verifying carbon impact.

        5.  Social Impact Tracking:
            - Metrics related to fair labor practices, community engagement, etc.
            - Stories or reports on social initiatives.

        6.  Resource Library:
            - Information and guides on sustainable agriculture practices.
            - Links to relevant policies and regulations.

        7.  Tools & Resources:
            - Links to external tools or features within DamDoh that support sustainability (e.g., water management calculators, soil health trackers).

        The UI should be visually engaging, potentially using charts and graphs
        to display progress. It should be accessible and easy to navigate for all
        stakeholders, with content tailored to their role (e.g., farmers tracking
 on-farm practices, buyers tracking sourcing sustainability).

        Consider AI integration here for:
        - Suggesting sustainable practices based on farm profile/location.
        - Estimating environmental impact based on logged activities.
        // - AI could analyze user-provided data (activity logs, input use)
        //   to estimate environmental metrics like carbon emissions, water usage,
        //   and nutrient efficiency.
        // - AI could potentially cross-reference logged practices with
        //   verified databases or certifications to assist in validating
        //   sustainable claims for reporting or market access.
        - Identifying market opportunities for sustainably certified products.
        - Providing personalized recommendations for relevant certifications or programs.

        Conceptual Data Flow and State Management:

        Data needed for this page:
        - Sustainability metrics (metrics: Metric[]): Data points like carbon footprint, water usage, etc.
          - Source: Could be fetched from a backend API endpoint specifically for sustainability data.
          - Could be calculated client-side or server-side based on user-logged activity (e.g., data from the 'Sustainable Practices Log' section, farm inputs, etc.).
        - Certification data (certifications: Certification[]): List of certifications held by the user, their status, expiry dates.
          - Source: Fetched from a backend API endpoint related to user profiles or a dedicated certifications collection.
        - Sustainable practices log data (practicesLog: PracticeLogEntry[]): History of logged sustainable activities.
          - Source: Fetched from a backend API endpoint for the 'Sustainable Practices Log'.
        - Tools/Resources data (tools: ToolLink[]): List of relevant tools and resources.
          - Source: Could be hardcoded, fetched from a configuration endpoint, or personalized based on user profile/location via AI.

        State variables needed:
        - `metricsData`: State to hold the fetched or calculated metrics.
        - `certificationsList`: State to hold the fetched certification data.
        - `practicesLogData`: State to hold the fetched practices log.
        - `isLoading`: Boolean state to indicate data loading status for displaying loading skeletons or spinners.
