 Conceptual UI Outline for FI/IP Portal - Applications Received Dashboard

 This page serves as a basic dashboard for Financial Institutions and
 Insurance Providers to manage applications initiated via the Marketplace.

 Layout:
 - Page Title: "Applications Received"
 - Filter/Search bar (conceptual): Allow filtering by product type, status, applicant.
 - List/Table of Applications:
 - Each row/item represents an application.
 - Display key details for each application:
 - Applicant Name (linked to UserProfile, conceptual)
 - Product Name (linked to financial_products/insurance_products, conceptual)
 - Product Type (Financial/Insurance)
 - Requested Amount (if applicable)
 - Application Date
 - Current Status (e.g., Pending Review, Approved, Rejected)
 - Conceptual Actions for each application:
 - "View Details" Button/Link: Navigate to a conceptual application detail view.
 - "Update Status" Dropdown/Button: Manually change application status (e.g., to Approved, Rejected).
 - "Contact Applicant" Button/Link: Initiate conceptual in-app messaging with the applicant.

 Data Flow (Conceptual):
 - Fetch applications where providerId matches the logged-in FI/IP user.
 - Display the list of applications.
 - User actions (View Details, Update Status) trigger conceptual backend calls.

 State Management (Conceptual):
 - State to hold the list of applications.
 - State for loading status.
 - State for filters/search term.
 - State for managing status updates (e.g., tracking which application is being updated).

        Conceptual UI Outline for FI/IP Portal - Applications Received Dashboard

        This page serves as a basic dashboard for Financial Institutions and
        Insurance Providers to manage applications initiated via the Marketplace.

        Layout:
        - Page Title: "Applications Received"
        - Filter/Search bar (conceptual): Allow filtering by product type, status, applicant.
        - List/Table of Applications:
          - Iterate through conceptualApplications to display each one.
          - Display key details for each application:
            - Applicant Name (linked to UserProfile, conceptual)
            - Product Name (linked to financial_products/insurance_products, conceptual)
            - Product Type (Financial/Insurance)
            - Requested Amount (if applicable)
            - Application Date
            - Current Status (Dynamically displayed)
          - Conceptual Actions for each application:
            - "View Details" Button/Link: Conceptually opens a modal or navigates to a detail page to show application details AND consented data.
            - "Update Status" Dropdown/Button: Manually change application status (e.g., to Approved, Rejected).
            - "Contact Applicant" Button/Link: Initiate conceptual in-app messaging with the applicant.

        Conceptual Application Detail View (Modal/Panel triggered by "View Details"):
        - Displays full application details (Applicant, Product, Dates, Status, etc.).
        - Dedicated section for CONSENTED DATA VIEW:
          - This section only appears if consent flags are true.
          - Clearly labels which data types are being displayed based on `consentGivenForDataSharing`.
          - Displays summary data conceptually fetched via the `requestVerifiedData` Cloud Function:
            - Farm Profile Summary (if `farmData` is true)
            - Relevant Marketplace Sales History (if `marketplaceSalesHistory` is true)
            - Traceability Summary (if `traceabilityReports` is true)
            - Carbon Footprint Data Summary (if `carbonFootprintData` is true)
          - Data here is READ-ONLY.
        - Manual Status Update controls within the detail view as well.

        Conceptual AI Integration - Suggested Farmers/Businesses Section:
        - A separate section on this dashboard (below applications, or in a dedicated tab/page).
        - Displays a list of farmers or businesses that the AI model suggests might be a good fit for the FI/IP's products.
        - Conceptual filtering/sorting options for suggestions.
        - Key details about the suggested farmer/business (name, location, possibly a brief, non-sensitive profile summary).
        - Conceptual Action: "View Profile" (perhaps a limited public profile view), "Contact Business" (initiate conceptual messaging), "Suggest Product" (link to sending them information about a specific product).

        AI Data Flow (Conceptual):
        - A conceptual Cloud Function (e.g., `onNewFarmerProfile`, `onUpdateFarmerProfile`, potentially triggered by FI/IP activity) runs an initial AI matching process.
        - This process conceptually uses farmer profile data (public/consented), their activity on the platform (marketplace, traceability, etc.), and the FI/IP's product eligibility criteria to generate potential matches.
        - The results are conceptually stored or made available for the FI/IP dashboard to fetch.
        - The AI recommendations are dynamic and could update over time.
        - Filtering/sorting the suggestions might also involve sending parameters to a conceptual backend/AI service.
        - Note: Access to detailed farmer data from this section would still be subject to the farmer applying and giving explicit consent (handled via the application view and the conceptual `requestVerifiedData` function).


        Data Flow (Conceptual):
        - Fetch applications where providerId matches the logged-in FI/IP user (simulated by conceptualApplications).
        - Display the list of applications.
        - User actions (View Details, Update Status) trigger conceptual backend calls.

        State Management (Conceptual):
        - State to hold the list of applications.
        - State for loading status.
        - State for filters/search term.
        - State for managing status updates (e.g., tracking which application is being updated, conceptual logic).
        - State to control the visibility and content of the conceptual Application Detail View modal/panel.
