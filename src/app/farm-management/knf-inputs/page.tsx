          usage: "Due to the complexity and time required to make high-quality BRV, many KNF practitioners purchase good quality, unpasteurized brown rice vinegar. If using: Dilute heavily, typically 1:200 to 1:500 or even 1:1000 depending on purpose (e.g., 2-5ml per liter of water). Can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench. Often used to sanitize tools or seeds (at higher concentrations, then rinsed). It's famously used in making WCA by dissolving eggshells. BRV can help sterilize the leaf surface and improve the uptake of other nutrients, especially during the changeover period from vegetative to reproductive growth. Always test on a small area first."

              <li><strong className="font-medium">Observe Plant Growth Stages:</strong> KNF inputs are most effective when applied according to the plant's current growth stage (e.g., FPJ for vegetative, WCA for fruiting). Matching input to stage is key.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Dilution is Critical:</strong> Most KNF inputs are highly concentrated and MUST be diluted significantly with non-chlorinated water before application (often 1:500 to 1:1000). Over-application can harm plants or soil life.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Use Local Materials:</strong> KNF emphasizes using resources available in your local environment (Indigenous Microorganisms, local plants for FPJ).</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Focus on Soil Life (IMO):</strong> The health and diversity of the soil microbiome, primarily enhanced by IMO, is paramount in KNF for nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and overall plant health.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Patience and Observation:</strong> Natural fermentation processes take time. Observe your plants, soil, and ferments closely to understand their responses and progress. KNF is an observational practice.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Avoid Mixing Certain Inputs:</strong> For example, LAB and OHN are generally not mixed or applied at the same time as they can have counteracting effects. Understand input compatibilities.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Timing of Application:</strong> Foliar sprays are often best applied in the early morning or late evening when stomata are open and the sun is not intense.</li>
              <li><strong className="font-medium">Cleanliness:</strong> Maintain cleanliness in your preparation areas and with your tools to avoid contamination of your ferments.</li>
            </ul>

              This guide provides a solid starting point. For deeper understanding, mastery, and adaptation to your specific environment, continuous learning through KNF literature, workshops, and experienced practitioners is highly recommended.
