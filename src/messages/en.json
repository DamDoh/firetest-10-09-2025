            "<b>Moisten the Mix:</b> Before filling your containers, put your seed starting mix into a bucket or tub and slowly add warm water, mixing with your hands until it's damp like a wrung-out sponge, but not soaking wet.",
            "<b>Fill Containers:</b> Fill your containers with the moistened mix, gently firming it down but not compacting it. Leave about a quarter-inch of space at the top.",
            "<b>Sow the Seeds:</b> Plant 2-3 seeds per cell or pot. A general rule of thumb is to plant a seed twice as deep as it is wide. Check the seed packet for specific instructions.",
            "<b>Cover and Label:</b> Lightly cover the seeds with more mix or vermiculite, then gently firm the surface. Immediately label your tray with the plant variety and the date sown.",
            "<b>Water Gently:</b> Water the surface gently with a spray bottle or from the bottom by placing your trays in a pan of water. This prevents seeds from washing away.",
            "<b>Provide Warmth & Cover:</b> Place the trays in a warm spot or on a heat mat. Cover with a plastic dome or plastic wrap to retain humidity until the seeds sprout. Remove the cover as soon as you see the first signs of green."

            "<b>Watering:</b> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. It's often best to water from the bottom to encourage deep root growth.",
            "<b>Thinning:</b> Once the seedlings have their first set of 'true leaves' (the second set that appears), choose the strongest-looking seedling in each cell and snip the others at the soil line with scissors. This prevents disturbing the roots of the winner.",
            "<b>Fertilizing:</b> Begin feeding your seedlings with a diluted, balanced liquid fertilizer (at quarter-strength) after they have 2-3 sets of true leaves. Feed about once a week.",
            "<b>Air Circulation:</b> A gentle fan blowing on your seedlings for a few hours a day helps prevent disease and strengthens their stems."
